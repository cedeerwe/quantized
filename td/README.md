# TD

This is the base for our tower defense game. Probably it is not going to be quantized, but whatever.

## Setup

Install `rustup` and `cargo` according to the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Run `cargo run`. It should work from scratch.

### Dev

If you would like to develop this project, our recommended setup is to work with `VSCode` using the marketplace extension `rust-analyzer`.
